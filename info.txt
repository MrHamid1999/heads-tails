I'm going to build a game called :   Head and Tails


in order to create this game,first of all I need a playground.My play ground Containes a background ,
a coin, a button and a counter to show how many times you won

first of all player have to choose head or tails.after choosing a one of this ,by clicking on the start button
the game will start


How it works????
when the player chooses a side , based on the choice that he made a value will be saved in a variable.
after clicking on start button a roandom number between 0 - 1.99 will be produced and then then we will round it.
if the number was equal to the value that player choose ,he will be the winner and opposite;


What kind of view the game will have??
we are going to make a dynomic page using js and css.for this game there will be a transform-3d option as
an important vision
